## About
I've created simple text editor with save and load functions. It works similar to React state. :)

## To Visitors
This project was a homework from [WTF co ten frontend](https://cotenfrontend.pl/) course. I've decided to focus more on the DOM action. Anyway, as you can see project doesn't look bad I think. :) I hope you like it. If you have any advices, just write me. :)
